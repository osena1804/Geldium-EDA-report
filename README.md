# Geldium-EDA-report
Exploratory data analysis and AI strategy for predicting credit card delinquency at Geldium.
# 📊 Geldium Credit Risk EDA Report

This project explores customer data from Geldium, a digital lending provider, to identify risk factors for credit card delinquency. It includes exploratory data analysis, missing data treatment, and a blueprint for AI-powered predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect patterns and risk indicators in customer behavior
- Design a predictive model to forecast delinquency
- Recommend AI-driven interventions for collections

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value imputation (median, mean)
- Correlation analysis
- Generative AI for summarization and insight extraction

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Top Predictors**: Missed payments, credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio
- **Anomalies**: High-income customers with delinquency, inconsistent employment labels
- **Data Quality**: Missing values in income, loan balance, and credit score addressed via imputation

## 📈 Next Steps
- Train predictive models (logistic regression, tree-based, neural networks)
- Build a risk engine to classify customers
- Integrate AI notifications for proactive collections
- Monitor model performance and retrain periodically

## 📁 Deliverables
- EDA Summary Report 
- README with project overview
